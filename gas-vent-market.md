<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas Vent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Tail Pipe type</li><li>Double Pailpipe Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gas vent market comprises two primary types: single tail pipe and double tail pipe systems. Single tail pipe systems utilize one exhaust outlet, effectively channeling vented gases from a single source, making them simpler and often more cost-effective for smaller applications. In contrast, double tail pipe systems feature two exhaust outlets, allowing for better dispersion of gases and improved ventilation, which can be crucial in larger installations or environments with stringent emission regulations, ensuring enhanced safety and efficiency.</p></p>

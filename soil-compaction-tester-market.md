<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Soil Compaction Tester Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fine Soil</li><li>Coarse Soil</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The soil compaction tester market is categorized into two main types: fine soil and coarse soil. Fine soil consists of small particles such as silt and clay, which require specific testing methods to assess compaction levels due to their plasticity and moisture retention. Coarse soil, made up of larger particles like sand and gravel, presents different compaction challenges, as it tends to drain well and require less effort for compaction. Both types are crucial in construction and agricultural applications for soil stability.</p></p>

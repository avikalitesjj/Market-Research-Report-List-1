<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Respirator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Constant Pressure Type</li><li>Constant Volume Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The artificial respirator market consists primarily of two types: constant pressure and constant volume. Constant pressure respirators maintain a predetermined airway pressure, ensuring a consistent supply of oxygen and aiding patients with difficulty breathing. In contrast, constant volume respirators deliver a set volume of air regardless of the airway pressures, focusing on tidal volume delivery. Both types are crucial for managing respiratory conditions, providing tailored support to patients based on their specific medical needs and conditions.</p></p>
